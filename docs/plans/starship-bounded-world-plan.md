# Plan: Bounded "Starship" Worlds + Player-less Pre-Sim

Status: **draft for review** · 2026-06-09 · branch `onion-arch-refactor`

A concrete, small instance of two capabilities the living-world roadmap parks as
"the hard parts": a **bounded spatial mode** (designed interiors, fixed topology)
and a **player-less forward simulation** (the world is alive before you arrive).
The starship is the ideal first instance because it is naturally small and closed.

## Goal

Create a new *type* of world — a small ship with **pre-defined, consistent
architecture** (bridge, crew quarters, sim deck, engine room, mess, med-bay) and
a stable room-connectivity graph; seed **3–5 crew NPCs**; run **~24–48 ticks** of
deterministic NPC life (movement, co-location, occasional conversation/planning
beats) *before any player turn exists*, so that when the player joins the world is
already mid-motion.

### Explicitly out of scope (now)
- **Map rendering.** We capture topology (rooms + connections + deck/layout hints)
  so a map is *possible*, but draw nothing yet.
- **Replacing open-world creation.** This is a new mode alongside today's open/OSM
  path, gated by `spatial_mode`.
- **LLM-driven per-tick NPC cognition.** Movement is pure code; LLM is reserved
  for threshold-gated beats only.

### Locked decisions (2026-06-09)
1. **Topology = authored templates + LLM dressing.** A small library of ship
   archetypes with hand-authored rooms + connectivity graph; the LLM only fills
   names, room descriptions, and crew. Guarantees a valid, consistent, map-able
   graph for free.
2. **Compact persistence.** Keep final NPC positions, the relationship graph, and
   a handful of notable beats as readable recent-history. Discard per-tick ambient
   movement.
3. **Deterministic moves + threshold-gated beats.** Pure-code movement/routines;
   LLM fires only when co-located NPCs have real tension and a cooldown elapsed.
   Target: < ~$1 and < ~3 min per world.

## Architecture overview

Two new use cases, a handful of pure domain services, three or four new ports, and
three migrations. Built in the onion layout (NOT `lib/`).

```
SeedBoundedWorld (use case)
  ├─ DeckPlanProvider port → authored template (rooms + graph + crew roles)
  ├─ writes places + place_connections (topology)
  ├─ LLM dressing/crew (Grok or Haiku) → characters + character_relationships + daily_loop
  └─ writes initial scene + spatial_mode='bounded' on world

SimulateWorldForward (use case, run via BackgroundTasks after seed)
  loop N ticks (a tick = one WorldTimeBand):
    ├─ npc-movement (pure)        : daily_loop + band + deck-graph → next room
    ├─ colocation (pure)          : group NPCs by current_place_id (reuse occupancy-sim)
    ├─ beat-gating (pure)         : tension(relationships) + cooldown → spend a beat?
    │     └─ DramaPort (Haiku)    : co-located group + goals/relationships → structured beat
    ├─ relationship-drift (pure)  : apply valence deltas from beat outcome
    └─ persist: current_place_id, character_relationships, timeline_events(sim_tick)

Player joins → opening turn assembled from sim end-state (positions + recent beats)
```

## Data model / migrations

Latest migration is **v25**. Add three, each idempotent DDL + a matching Mongoose
model in `infrastructure/persistence/mongo/models/`.

**v26 — bounded spatial mode + topology**
- `worlds.spatial_mode TEXT DEFAULT 'open'` (`open` | `bounded`)
- `worlds.template_id TEXT` (which deck-plan seeded it; null for open)
- `places.deck TEXT` (deck/level grouping for future map layering)
- `places.layout_hint TEXT` (nullable JSON `{x,y}`/zone for future map)
- `place_connections (id, world_id, from_place_id, to_place_id, kind TEXT,
  bidirectional INTEGER DEFAULT 1, created_at)` — `kind`: corridor/hatch/door/
  ladder/airlock. The topology graph.

**v27 — relationship graph** (the roadmap's "key missing table")
- `character_relationships (id, world_id, from_character_id, to_character_id,
  kind TEXT, valence REAL DEFAULT 0, note TEXT, updated_at)` — `kind`: rival/ally/
  mentor/romance/superior/subordinate/…; `valence` in −1..1 drives drift + beat
  gating.

**v28 — sim provenance on the timeline**
- `timeline_events.turn_id` → make **nullable** (sim events have no player turn).
- `timeline_events.sim_tick INTEGER` (nullable) + `provenance TEXT DEFAULT 'turn'`
  (`turn` | `sim`). Keeps ONE timeline the narrator already reads, instead of a
  parallel table. This is the concrete fix for the roadmap's "turn-coupled `[t:N]`
  provenance" landmine.

No new runtime-state table: final positions live on `characters.current_place_id`,
relationship state on `character_relationships`, history on `timeline_events`.

## New domain services (pure, `domain/services/`)
- `deck-graph.ts` — adjacency / neighbors / next-hop / **connectivity validation**
  (no orphan rooms; every room reachable from the bridge).
- `npc-movement.ts` — `(daily_loop, band, currentPlace, graph) → nextPlaceId`.
  Skeleton rule: move toward the routine's target room for this band (teleport for
  a 6-room ship; graph used for validation + future travel-time).
- `colocation.ts` — group NPCs by room this tick (lean on `occupancy-sim.ts`).
- `beat-gating.ts` — `(group, relationships, lastBeatTick) → boolean` tension +
  cooldown gate. Pure; the only thing that authorizes LLM spend.
- `relationship-drift.ts` — apply valence deltas from a beat outcome.

## New ports (`domain/ports/`) + adapters (`infrastructure/`)
- `deck-plan-provider.ts` — returns authored templates (rooms, graph, crew roles).
  Adapter reads from a `ship-templates/` constant or dir.
- `place-connection-repository.ts` — CRUD topology edges.
- `relationship-repository.ts` — CRUD `character_relationships`.
- `drama-port.ts` (the roadmap's `LlmDramaPort`) — `(group, relationships, threads)
  → structured beat`. Haiku-backed. Beats are structured event summaries (not full
  generated dialogue) per the "compact" decision.
- Timeline **write** access: today `dossier-repository` only reads. Add a
  `timeline-repository` write port (or extend dossier) so the sim can append events.

All four/five register in `composition/container.ts` (`Container` type + both the
SQLite and Mongo builders).

## Reuse map (don't rebuild)
- **Routines** → `characters.daily_loop` (v24) already models `WorldTimeBand →
  {activity, place}`. Seeding sets each crew member's loop to real rooms.
- **Time bands** → `world-clock.ts: worldTimeBand()`. A **tick = one band**, so
  ~4 ticks/in-world-day; 24–48 ticks ≈ 6–12 days.
- **Co-location / occupancy** → `occupancy-sim.ts` grouping + `occupancy-repository`.
- **Name → room snapping** → extend `name-resolution.ts: placesMatch()` to resolve
  against the fixed room manifest.
- **Reverie repeat-avoidance** (Jaccard) → reuse so beats don't repeat.

## Agent behavior forks (gated on `spatial_mode='bounded'`)
- **Narrator** (`prompts/narrator-system.md`): inject a **ship bible** (room
  manifest + current NPC positions) and a rule — *only reference known rooms;
  movement only across connections; never invent a deck.* Build the block in the
  context assembler (`lib/world-state.ts`, being strangled), appended for bounded
  worlds.
- **Archivist** (`prompts/archivist-system.md`): in bounded mode **do not create
  new top-level places** — snap mentioned locations to existing rooms. This inverts
  today's "places emerge from prose" assumption; it is the subtlest behavioral
  change and must be mode-gated so open worlds are unaffected.
- **Join hand-off**: a `BOUNDED_OPENING_DIRECTIVE` replacing today's "no history
  yet" — *the world is mid-motion; here is recent history and where everyone is;
  open in medias res.* The state block includes current positions + recent
  `provenance='sim'` timeline events.

## Cost model (sanity check)
- Crew + dressing: 1–2 LLM calls at seed.
- Sim: ~24–48 ticks, beats gated → estimate ≤ ~15 beats, Haiku, structured → cents.
- Comfortably under the < ~$1 / < ~3 min budget. The deterministic spine is free.

## Walking-skeleton sequencing
Each phase ends with a concrete, verifiable artifact. Per CLAUDE.md, a sim/narrator
change isn't "done" until a turn streams end-to-end in the browser.

- **P0 — schema + types.** Migrations v26–v28, entities, ports (no behavior). Boot
  applies clean; typecheck + `depcruise` green.
- **P1 — seed one hardcoded ship.** `DeckPlanProvider` returns a single "scout"
  template; `SeedBoundedWorld` writes places + connections + crew + relationships +
  daily_loops. Verify via an **offline script** (`scripts/seed-ship.mjs`, roadmap's
  "offline script first") that the DB holds a connected ship + 3–5 crew.
- **P2 — deterministic sim, no LLM.** `SimulateWorldForward` runs movement +
  co-location + drift for N ticks, logs deterministic events. Verify NPCs move
  sanely and end in plausible rooms; `deck-graph` validation passes.
- **P3 — threshold-gated beats.** Add `DramaPort` (Haiku); a few beats generate and
  persist as `provenance='sim'` timeline events. Verify spend stays in budget.
- **P4 — join hand-off.** Bounded opening directive + assembler surfaces positions
  and recent beats; **play a turn in the browser** and confirm it reads as alive.
- **P5 — harden + generalize.** Agent forks (narrator room-constraint, archivist
  snap-to-room), creation UI + "world warming up" state, Mongo model/repo parity,
  add a second ship template.

## P1 prerequisites (discovered during P0)
The live SQLite read paths delegate to legacy `lib/` modules whose row types
partially shadow the domain entities, masked by `as` casts — so a field added to a
domain entity is NOT automatically returned at runtime. P0 fixed the urgent one;
P1 must close the rest **before** seeding/branching on them:
- **World (fixed in P0):** `lib/worlds.ts` `getWorld`/`createWorld` now SELECT/RETURN
  `spatial_mode` + `template_id` so `world.spatial_mode === 'bounded'` is real, not
  `undefined`. The `WorldRepository` port uses `lib/worlds`' `World` (a re-export of
  the domain `World`), so this flows through.
- **Place (P1):** `PlaceRepository` reads through `lib/world-state`'s `Place` type,
  which does NOT carry the new `deck`/`layout_hint`. When seeding writes `deck` and
  the sim reads it, extend that read type + its SELECT (or give bounded worlds a
  dedicated place read), or `place.deck` will be `undefined` at runtime.
- **TimelineEvent (P3/P4):** same masked-cast risk for `sim_tick`/`provenance` on
  whatever path reads timeline rows for narrator context — verify the SELECT carries
  them before relying on `provenance === 'sim'`.

## P1 implementation spec (seed pipeline — binding for the build)
P0 left the write repos as ports only and the place/character repos read-only.
P1 adds the minimal write surface and the seed use case. Decisions are fixed here
so the implementation stays coherent.

**Write surface** (extend existing ports + add BOTH SQLite and Mongo adapters —
CRUD includes create):
- `WorldRepository.createBounded({ name, premise, initialStateJson, templateId }):
  Promise<{ id: number }>` — inserts ONLY a `worlds` row with `spatial_mode='bounded'`.
  It must NOT auto-seed a place/character/scene the way `lib/worlds.createWorld`
  does for open worlds (the seeder writes its own rooms/crew).
- `PlaceRepository.add({ world_id, name, description, kind, deck, layout_hint }):
  Promise<{ id: number }>`.
- `CharacterRepository.add({ world_id, name, description, is_player, current_place_id,
  role, active_goal, daily_loop }): Promise<{ id: number }>` (daily_loop is JSON text).
- `PlaceConnectionRepository.add` and `RelationshipRepository.upsert` already exist as
  ports — implement their SQLite + Mongo adapters (neither has one yet).
- Read-path fix: extend `lib/world-state`'s `Place` type + its SELECT to carry `deck`
  + `layout_hint` so seeded decks read back (the flagged Place prerequisite).

**CrewGenerator port** (`domain/ports/crew-generator.ts`) — the Grok seam:
- In: `{ template: DeckPlanTemplate, premise: string, playerName?: string }`.
- Out (Zod-validated in the adapter): `{ shipName, premise, roomDressing: [{ key,
  description }], crew: [{ role, name, persona, goal, homeRoomKey, dailyLoop }] (3-5),
  relationships: [{ fromRole, toRole, kind, valence (-1..1) }] }`.
- Impls: `GrokCrewGenerator` (`infrastructure/world-gen/`) — `generateObject` with
  `grok-4.3` via `@ai-sdk/xai`, model id from `infrastructure/llm/`, prompt from
  `prompts/crew-dressing.md`. Plus a deterministic `StubCrewGenerator` for tests +
  the offline script (no spend, no key).

**SeedBoundedWorld use case** (`application/use-cases/seed-bounded-world.ts`):
- Deps: `{ decks, crew, worlds, places, placeConnections, characters, relationships,
  clock }`. Pure orchestration — no SQL/SDK.
- Flow: getTemplate → createBounded world → write rooms (map `room.key` → new place id),
  apply roomDressing → write edges (map keys → ids) → crew.generate → write crew
  (`homeRoomKey` → `current_place_id`, daily_loop) → upsert relationships (role →
  character id) → validate with `deck-graph.isConnected` (throw if not) → return
  `{ worldId, placeIds, characterIds }`.

**Offline script** `scripts/seed-ship.mjs`: build the container, swap in
`StubCrewGenerator`, run `SeedBoundedWorld` against a temp SQLite DB
(`DATABASE_PATH=/tmp/...`), print rooms + graph + crew + relationships, assert the
graph is connected and crew count is 3-5. The real `GrokCrewGenerator` is wired in the
container; a live Grok smoke test is a manual follow-up, not part of the automated run.

**Deferred to P4:** the initial active scene + world cursor (needed for `/play`, not
for the P1 "DB holds a connected ship + crew" proof).

## P2 implementation spec (deterministic forward sim — binding)
The player-less sim loop, deterministic only (no LLM — beats are P3). Proves NPCs
move on their routines over N ticks and the world clock advances; persists compact
end-state (final positions + relationship drift + world time), per the locked decisions.

**New pure domain service** `domain/services/sim-clock.ts`:
- A tick = one `WorldTimeBand`. `tickToBand(tick): WorldTimeBand` cycles
  morning→midday→evening→night. `tickToWorldTime(tick, startDay=1): string` → a
  label like `Day 1 — morning` (so ~4 ticks/day; 24 ticks ≈ 6 days). Pure, tested.

**Add to `domain/services/relationship-drift.ts`:** `coLocationOutcome(valence:
number): BeatOutcome` — the deterministic drift trigger (valence ≥ 0 → 'positive'
i.e. allies bond when together; < 0 → 'negative' i.e. rivals chafe). Tested.

**Write surface** (ports + SQLite + Mongo adapters):
- `CharacterRepository.setPlace(characterId: number, placeId: number | null): Promise<void>`.
- `WorldRepository.setWorldTime(worldId: number, worldTime: string): Promise<void>`.
- Reuse the existing `RelationshipRepository.adjustValence(id, delta)` (delta-based) —
  no new relationship write.

**SimulateWorldForward use case** (`application/use-cases/simulate-world-forward.ts`):
- Deps: `{ characters, placeConnections, relationships, clock }`. Pure orchestration.
- Load: NPCs (`is_player=0`) with `current_place_id` + parsed `daily_loop` JSON
  projected to `ResolvedDailyLoop` (band → place_id); `place_connections` →
  `buildDeckGraph` → `neighborsOf`; relationships (held as a mutable working copy).
- Loop `tick = 0..N-1`: `band = tickToBand(tick)`; per NPC `nextPlaceId(...)` →
  update in-memory position; `coLocatedGroups(...)`; for each relationship whose
  both endpoints are co-located, `applyDrift(workingRel, driftFromOutcome(
  coLocationOutcome(workingRel.valence)))` (clamped in-memory).
- Persist ONCE at the end (compact): `setPlace` per NPC (final room),
  `adjustValence(id, finalValence − originalValence)` per drifted relationship,
  `setWorldTime(worldId, tickToWorldTime(N))`. No timeline events in P2 (beats=P3).
- Return `{ ticks: N, finalPositions, drifted }`.

**Offline proof** `scripts/sim-ship.mjs`: seed a scout (stub crew) → run
SimulateWorldForward for 24 ticks → print final positions + world time + drifted
relationships; assert every NPC's final room matches its routine for the final tick's
band and the clock advanced. (Extends the P1 seed-script pattern; stub crew, no spend.)

## Risks / things to validate
- **daily_loop place references** must point at real seeded rooms, not free text —
  enforce at seed time.
- **Movement granularity**: teleport-to-routine-target is fine for 6 rooms;
  revisit hop-by-hop only if travel-time matters.
- **Mongo parity doubles persistence work** — every new table needs a Mongoose
  model + `.mongo` repo or the `PERSISTENCE=mongo` suite breaks.
- **Onion/CI**: no `lib/` imports from new code; `dependency-cruiser` enforces.
- **Timeline write port**: confirm whether the archivist already writes
  `timeline_events` through a seam we can reuse before adding a new port.
